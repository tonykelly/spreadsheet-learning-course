## Topic 1: Introduction to Spreadsheet Applications

### What is a Spreadsheet?
A spreadsheet is a computer program that organizes data in rows and columns, similar to a digital ledger or table. Think of it as an electronic version of an accountant's ledger book, but much more powerful and flexible.

### Common Uses for Spreadsheets:
- **Personal Finance**: Track expenses, create budgets, monitor savings
- **Business**: Manage inventories, track sales, calculate payroll
- **Education**: Grade tracking, attendance records, project planning
- **Home Management**: Meal planning, household chores, vacation planning
- **Data Analysis**: Organizing information to find patterns and insights

### Understanding Excel vs. Google Sheets

**Microsoft Excel:**
- Desktop application (also available online)
- Part of Microsoft Office suite
- Requires purchase or subscription
- More advanced features for complex calculations
- Better for handling very large datasets

**Google Sheets:**
- Web-based application (works in your browser)
- Part of Google Workspace (formerly G Suite)
- Completely free with Google account
- Excellent for collaboration and sharing
- Automatic saving to the cloud

### Step-by-Step: Getting Started

**For Excel:**
1. If you have Excel installed: Click the Start menu → Microsoft Office → Excel
2. If you don't have Excel: Go to office.com → Sign in with Microsoft account → Click Excel
3. Click "Blank workbook" to start fresh

**For Google Sheets:**
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to sheets.google.com
3. Sign in with your Google account (create one if needed at accounts.google.com)
4. Click the "+" button or "Blank" to create a new spreadsheet

## Topic 2: Understanding the Grid System

### The Spreadsheet Grid
When you open a spreadsheet, you'll see a grid made up of:

#### Cells
- Each rectangle in the grid is called a **cell**
- This is where you enter information (text, numbers, formulas)
- Only one cell can be selected (active) at a time
- The active cell has a colored border around it

#### Rows
- Horizontal lines of cells
- Numbered from 1, 2, 3, and so on
- Excel has over 1 million rows; Google Sheets starts with 1,000 but can add more

#### Columns  
- Vertical lines of cells
- Labeled with letters: A, B, C... Z, then AA, AB, AC, etc.
- Excel has over 16,000 columns; Google Sheets has 26 columns by default

#### Cell Addresses
Every cell has a unique "address" combining its column letter and row number:
- **A1** = Column A, Row 1 (top-left cell)
- **B5** = Column B, Row 5
- **Z100** = Column Z, Row 100

### Step-by-Step: Understanding Cell Addresses
1. **Click on different cells** and watch the cell address change
2. **Look for the Name Box** (shows current cell address):
   - In Excel: Upper-left corner above the grid
   - In Google Sheets: Left side of the formula bar
3. **Practice**: Click on cell D7 and verify it shows "D7" in the Name Box

### Worksheets vs. Workbooks

**Worksheet (or Sheet):**
- A single page/tab in your spreadsheet file
- Contains the grid of cells you work with
- Think of it like one page in a notebook

**Workbook (Excel) / Spreadsheet (Google Sheets):**
- The entire file containing one or more worksheets
- Like a complete notebook with multiple pages
- Can contain dozens of worksheets for organizing different types of data

### Step-by-Step: Working with Sheet Tabs
1. **Find the sheet tabs** at the bottom of your screen
2. **Default name**: Usually "Sheet1" for your first worksheet
3. **Create a new sheet**:
   - Excel: Right-click on sheet tab → Insert → Worksheet
   - Google Sheets: Click the "+" button next to sheet tabs
4. **Rename a sheet**:
   - Excel: Right-click sheet tab → Rename
   - Google Sheets: Right-click sheet tab → Rename

## Topic 3: Basic Navigation

### Mouse Navigation
- **Click any cell** to select it
- **Click and drag** to select multiple cells
- **Double-click a cell** to edit its contents
- **Scroll** using your mouse wheel or scroll bars

### Essential Keyboard Shortcuts
These shortcuts work in both Excel and Google Sheets:

| Action | Shortcut | What it does |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Move right | Tab or → | Moves to the next cell to the right |
| Move left | Shift + Tab or ← | Moves to the cell to the left |
| Move down | Enter or ↓ | Moves to the cell below |
| Move up | Shift + Enter or ↑ | Moves to the cell above |
| Go to cell A1 | Ctrl + Home | Jumps to the top-left cell |
| Copy | Ctrl + C | Copies selected content |
| Paste | Ctrl + V | Pastes copied content |
| Undo | Ctrl + Z | Undoes the last action |

### Step-by-Step: Navigation Practice
1. **Start at cell A1**
2. **Press Tab** four times (you should be at cell E1)
3. **Press Enter** three times (you should be at cell E4)
4. **Press Ctrl + Home** (you should return to cell A1)
5. **Practice clicking different cells** and using arrow keys to move around

### Selection Techniques

**Single Cell Selection:**
- Click once on any cell

**Range Selection (multiple cells):**
- Click and drag from one cell to another
- Or click first cell, hold Shift, click last cell
- Example: Select A1 to C3 by clicking A1, holding Shift, clicking C3

**Entire Row Selection:**
- Click on the row number (1, 2, 3, etc.)

**Entire Column Selection:**
- Click on the column letter (A, B, C, etc.)

**Multiple Non-Adjacent Selections:**
- Select first range
- Hold Ctrl (Windows) or Cmd (Mac)
- Select additional ranges while holding the key

### Step-by-Step: Selection Practice
1. **Select cell B2** by clicking on it
2. **Select range A1:C3** by clicking A1, holding Shift, clicking C3
3. **Select entire column A** by clicking the "A" header
4. **Select entire row 5** by clicking the "5" on the left side
5. **Practice non-adjacent selection**: Select A1, hold Ctrl, select C3, hold Ctrl, select E5

## Topic 4: Simple Data Entry

### Types of Data You Can Enter

**Text (Labels):**
- Names, descriptions, headers
- Example: "Student Name", "Product Description"
- Appears left-aligned in cells by default

**Numbers:**
- Quantities, prices, scores, dates
- Example: 25, 3.14, 1500
- Appears right-aligned in cells by default

**Dates:**
- Type in various formats: 1/15/2024, Jan 15, 2024, 15-Jan-24
- Spreadsheets automatically recognize and format dates

### Step-by-Step: Basic Data Entry
1. **Click on cell A1**
2. **Type**: "Name" (this is a text label)
3. **Press Tab** to move to B1
4. **Type**: "Age" 
5. **Press Tab** to move to C1
6. **Type**: "Score"
7. **Press Enter** to move to the next row
8. **In cell A2, type**: "John"
9. **In cell B2, type**: 25
10. **In cell C2, type**: 87.5

### Auto-Fill Feature
Auto-fill is a powerful feature that can automatically continue patterns or copy data.

**How Auto-Fill Works:**
- Enter data in one or more cells
- Select the cell(s)
- Look for the small square in the bottom-right corner (fill handle)
- Click and drag the fill handle to extend the pattern

### Step-by-Step: Using Auto-Fill
1. **In cell D1, type**: "January"
2. **Press Enter**, then click back on D1
3. **Look for the small square** in the bottom-right corner of the cell
4. **Click and drag** that square to the right through column G
5. **Release the mouse** - you should see: January, February, March, April

**Other Auto-Fill Examples:**
- Type "1" in A1, "2" in A2, select both, then drag down = 3, 4, 5, 6...
- Type "Monday" and drag = Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday...
- Type "Q1" and drag = Q2, Q3, Q4...

### Visual Reference Screenshots:

- **Taking Screenshots in Excel**: [How to Take Screenshot Excel](https://recorder.itopvpn.com/blog/screenshot-excel-2567) - Shows various Excel interface elements including fill handle

### Undo and Redo
**Undo (Ctrl + Z):**
- Reverses your last action
- Can undo multiple actions by pressing repeatedly

**Redo:**
- Excel: Ctrl + Y
- Google Sheets: Ctrl + Shift + Z
- Redoes an action you just undid

### Step-by-Step: Undo Practice
1. **Type something** in any cell
2. **Press Ctrl + Z** to undo it
3. **Press the redo shortcut** to bring it back
