## Topic 1: Data Organization Principles

### Setting Up Data for Success
Before you can effectively sort and filter data, it's crucial to organize it properly. Well-structured data makes everything else easier and more reliable.

### Visual Reference Screenshots:
- [Excel Sorting Guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sort-data-in-a-range-or-table-62d0b95d-2a90-4610-a6ae-2e545c4a4654) - Shows proper data organization for sorting
- [Google Sheets Filtering](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3540681?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) - Demonstrates data organization and filtering setup

### Essential Data Organization Rules:

#### 1. Headers in Row 1
- **Each column** should have a clear, descriptive header
- **Headers should be** in the first row of your data
- **Avoid empty rows** between headers and data
- **Example**: "Employee Name", "Department", "Hire Date", "Salary"

#### 2. One Data Type per Column
- **Don't mix** text and numbers in the same column
- **Use consistent formats** (all dates as MM/DD/YYYY)
- **Avoid merged cells** - they break sorting and filtering
- **Keep data clean** and uniform

#### 3. No Empty Rows or Columns
- **Avoid gaps** in your data range
- **Remove blank rows** within your data
- **Keep related data** in contiguous columns
- **Use tables** or defined ranges when possible

#### 4. Consistent Formatting
- **Same date format** throughout (MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY)
- **Consistent text case** ("Sales" not "sales" and "SALES")
- **Number formatting** should be uniform (currency, decimals)
- **No extra spaces** before or after text

### Step-by-Step: Preparing Data for Sorting and Filtering

1. **Create proper headers**:
   - A1: "Employee Name"
   - B1: "Department"
   - C1: "Hire Date"
   - D1: "Salary"
   - E1: "Performance Rating"

2. **Enter consistent data**:
   - Use same date format throughout (MM/DD/YYYY)
   - Format salary as currency
   - Use consistent department names (not "Sales" and "sales")

3. **Remove formatting issues**:
   - No merged cells
   - No empty rows within data
   - Consistent text formatting

4. **Select your data range** properly:
   - Include headers in selection
   - Make sure there are no gaps
   - Verify data types are consistent

### Practice Exercise: Data Preparation
Create an employee database with proper structure:
1. **Headers**: Name, Department, Hire Date, Salary, Performance
2. **Sample data**: At least 10 employees with varied information
3. **Consistent formatting**: Same date format, currency for salary
4. **Clean structure**: No empty rows, proper headers

## Topic 2: Basic Sorting

### Understanding Sorting
Sorting rearranges your data rows based on the values in one or more columns. It's essential for organizing information and finding patterns.

### Single-Column Sorting

#### Quick Sort (A-Z, Z-A)
- **Select any cell** in the column you want to sort
- **Use toolbar buttons**: A-Z (ascending) or Z-A (descending)
- **Excel**: Data tab → Sort A to Z / Sort Z to A
- **Google Sheets**: Data menu → Sort sheet A → Z / Sort sheet Z → A

#### Step-by-Step: Single-Column Sort
1. **Click any cell** in the column you want to sort (e.g., Department column)
2. **Excel**: Data tab → Sort A to Z
3. **Google Sheets**: Data menu → Sort sheet A → Z
4. **Result**: All data rows rearrange based on department names

### Custom Single-Column Sorting

#### Sort by Numbers (Largest to Smallest)
1. **Select any cell** in a number column (like Salary)
2. **Excel**: Data tab → Sort Largest to Smallest
3. **Google Sheets**: Data menu → Sort sheet Z → A
4. **Result**: Highest salaries appear first

#### Sort by Dates (Newest to Oldest)
1. **Select any cell** in date column
2. **Use Z-A sort** for newest first
3. **Use A-Z sort** for oldest first

### Multi-Level Sorting
Multi-level sorting sorts by multiple columns in priority order - primary sort, then secondary sort for ties, etc.

#### Step-by-Step: Multi-Level Sort Setup

**Excel Process:**
1. **Select your entire data range** (including headers)
2. **Data tab** → Sort (the main Sort button, not A-Z)
3. **First sort level**: Choose primary column (e.g., Department)
4. **Add Level**: Click "Add Level" for secondary sort
5. **Second sort level**: Choose secondary column (e.g., Salary - largest to smallest)
6. **Click OK**

**Google Sheets Process:**
1. **Select your data range** (including headers)
2. **Data menu** → Sort range → Advanced range sorting options
3. **Sort by**: Choose primary column
4. **Then by**: Choose secondary column
5. **Apply**

### Multi-Level Sorting Example:
**Scenario**: Sort employees by Department, then by Salary (highest first)

1. **Primary sort**: Department (A to Z)
2. **Secondary sort**: Salary (largest to smallest)
3. **Result**: All IT employees grouped together, with highest-paid IT employee first, then all Sales employees grouped, with highest-paid Sales employee first

### Practice Exercise: Complex Sorting
Create a student grade report and practice multi-level sorting:

1. **Create student data**:
   - Student Name, Class (A, B, C), Subject, Grade (0-100)
   - Create at least 15 rows of varied data

2. **Perform different sorts**:
   - **Sort 1**: By Class, then by Student Name
   - **Sort 2**: By Subject, then by Grade (highest first)
   - **Sort 3**: By Grade (lowest first) to identify students needing help

3. **Observe** how sorting affects data analysis and insights

## Topic 3: Filtering Techniques

### Understanding Filters
Filtering shows only the rows that meet specific criteria, temporarily hiding the rest. Unlike sorting, filtering doesn't rearrange data—it just controls what's visible.

### AutoFilter Basics

#### Enabling AutoFilter
**Excel:**
1. **Select any cell** in your data
2. **Data tab** → Filter
3. **Dropdown arrows** appear on each header

**Google Sheets:**
1. **Select your data range**
2. **Data menu** → Create a filter
3. **Filter icons** appear on headers

### Types of Filters:

#### 1. Text Filters
- **Equals**: Show only specific text matches
- **Contains**: Show rows containing specific text
- **Begins with**: Show rows starting with specific text
- **Does not contain**: Exclude rows with specific text

#### 2. Number Filters
- **Equals**: Exact number matches
- **Greater than**: Numbers above a threshold
- **Less than**: Numbers below a threshold
- **Between**: Numbers within a range
- **Top 10**: Highest or lowest values

#### 3. Date Filters
- **Equals**: Specific dates
- **Before/After**: Dates relative to a point
- **Between**: Date ranges
- **This month/year**: Relative date periods
- **Custom dates**: Specific date criteria

### Step-by-Step: Basic Filtering

1. **Enable filters** on your data
2. **Click dropdown arrow** on column header
3. **Uncheck items** you want to hide
4. **Or use search box** to find specific items
5. **Click OK** to apply filter

### Multiple Column Filtering
You can filter multiple columns simultaneously:

1. **Apply first filter** (e.g., Department = "Sales")
2. **Apply second filter** (e.g., Salary > 50000)
3. **Result**: Only Sales employees earning over $50,000 show

### Clearing Filters
- **Single column**: Click dropdown → Clear Filter
- **All columns**: Data tab → Clear (Excel) or Data menu → Remove filter (Sheets)

### Practice Exercise: Employee Analysis
Using your employee data:

1. **Filter by department**: Show only IT employees
2. **Add salary filter**: Show IT employees earning > $70,000
3. **Filter by hire date**: Show employees hired in last 2 years
4. **Clear filters** and try different combinations

## Topic 4: Advanced Filtering and Data Validation

### Advanced Filter (Excel)
Advanced Filter provides more sophisticated filtering options than AutoFilter.

#### When to Use Advanced Filter:
- **Complex criteria** with multiple conditions
- **Extract unique records** to another location
- **OR conditions** across multiple columns
- **Calculated criteria** using formulas

#### Step-by-Step: Advanced Filter Setup

1. **Create criteria range**:
   - Copy headers to empty area
   - Enter criteria below headers
   - Example: Department = "Sales" AND Salary > 60000

2. **Use Advanced Filter**:
   - Data tab → Advanced
   - Set list range (your data)
   - Set criteria range (your conditions)
   - Choose filter in place or copy to another location

### Data Validation for Clean Data Entry
Data validation controls what users can enter in cells, preventing errors and ensuring consistency.

#### Common Validation Types:

1. **Drop-down Lists**:
   - Create list of acceptable values
   - Users can only select from the list
   - Prevents spelling errors and ensures consistency

2. **Number Ranges**:
   - Limit entries to specific number ranges
   - Example: Grades between 0 and 100
   - Prevents impossible values

3. **Date Ranges**:
   - Restrict dates to specific periods
   - Example: Future dates only for scheduling
   - Prevents invalid date entries

4. **Text Length**:
   - Control minimum/maximum text length
   - Example: Employee ID must be exactly 6 characters
   - Ensures proper formatting

#### Step-by-Step: Creating Dropdown Lists

**Excel:**
1. **Select cells** where you want dropdown
2. **Data tab** → Data Validation
3. **Allow**: List
4. **Source**: Type values separated by commas, or reference a range
5. **Click OK**

**Google Sheets:**
1. **Select cells** for dropdown
2. **Data menu** → Data validation
3. **Criteria**: List of items
4. **Enter values** or reference range
5. **Done**

### Validation Error Messages
You can customize error messages when users enter invalid data:

1. **Set up validation rule**
2. **Error Alert tab** (Excel) or **Show validation help text** (Sheets)
3. **Create custom message**: "Please enter a value between 1 and 100"
4. **Choose error style**: Stop, Warning, or Information

### Practice Exercise: Product Inventory Management System
Create a comprehensive system using sorting, filtering, and validation:

1. **Set up product data**:
   - Product Name, Category, Price, Stock Level, Supplier, Reorder Date

2. **Add data validation**:
   - Category: Dropdown list (Electronics, Clothing, Books, etc.)
   - Price: Must be > 0
   - Stock Level: Whole numbers only
   - Reorder Date: Future dates only

3. **Practice operations**:
   - Sort by category, then by price
   - Filter low stock items (< 10 units)
   - Filter by supplier and category
   - Find products needing reorder (date approaching)

4. **Advanced analysis**:
   - Use Advanced Filter to find Electronics under $50 with low stock
   - Create summary views with different filter combinations
